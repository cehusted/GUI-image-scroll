# GUI Demo of Image Scrolling
## Description
This is another exercise in PyQt5 I came up with to practice displaying many images in a GUI in such a way that I could scroll through them all at once. This project contains nothing more than that, and was created purely as a proof-of-concept for myself that I could easily reimplement later down the line.

Pictures sampled are from houses dataset: https://github.com/emanhamed/Houses-dataset

### To get this running:
* Download both .py files, put in same directory
* pip install the PySide2 package
* Open command prompt to directory, type "python scroll-image-test.py"
